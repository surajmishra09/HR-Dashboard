## Task List


• How many head counts of Total employee in HR dept.

• What is attrition rate.

• How many people are active in department wise.

• What are the age bands of active employee whether they are young or whether they are within 30s or above 40s and so on.




This Dashboard is completely dynamic through we can see the granularity of data. For that I used quick filter and also used action filter so if I am clicking in any department it is going to give data for only that department.Also created Education field wise attrition like in Life science background how many employee are active and what are the attrition rate. So in this way we can give insight of HR Department.Similarly added one parameter in Dashboard name ’Age bin’ so whenever I am clicking its changing with age gap of employee.So from this dashboard we can analyse total insight from HR Dept.
